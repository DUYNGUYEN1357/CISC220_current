    "# Scope and lifetime of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The contiguous region of the program where an identifier (name) can be accessed is called the *scope* of the identifier. C and Java share similarities in that blocks determine the scope of identifiers, but there are\n",
    "different kinds of scope in the two languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifetime of an object determines when it is valid to use the object. In Java, the programmer usually is\n",
    "not concerned about object lifetime because the language uses garbage collection to release memory used by\n",
    "objects that can no longer be accessed. Furthermore, there are no pointers in Java which means that it is\n",
    "usually impossible to obtain a reference to a \"dead\" object. In C, the existance of pointers and the ability\n",
    "to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory means that the programmer must always be aware of object lifetime\n",
    "issues.\n",
